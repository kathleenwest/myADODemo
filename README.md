# myADODemo
A simple windows form application that uses ADO.NET to connect to an existing (pre-installed) SQL Server Database to query and then display product categories into a Data Table Grid View on the form.

Comments: You need to install the Northwind database to an SQL Server instance on your computer or server, then modify the application's connection string to connect to your unique server SQL database instance.
